CSSapp v0.10 Installation and Use               W. Tireman   NMU   February 2015

A GEANT4 Simulation used to simulate a compton suppression spectrometer for 
gamma ray spectroscopy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.10 works with GEANT4.10.0.p01

INTRODUCTION:
=============

This document describes the installation and use of the CSSapp
program which is based on GEANT4 and is designed to simulate the 
interaction of gamma rays with a NaI detector and a plastic 
scintillation Compton Suppression Detector.  The code is being 
by Faculty and Students at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, 
Michigan, USA. 

PHYSICS OVERVIEW:
=================
This currently uses the built in FTFP_BERT physics class.  

REQUIREMENTS:
=============

This release (v0.10) was tested with GEANT4.10.0.p01 (15-Feb-2015) on 
Ubuntu Linux 14.04 with gcc version 4.8.2.  In addition to GEANT4.10.0, 
data files for low-energy electromagnetic processes, G4EMLOW v6.35, 
available from the GEANT4 distribution site.  If other data files are 
needed for other physics lists, such as 'np' versions for neutron
data, you will need to make sure they are installed as well.

The program is compiled using Cmake v1.2.1.  A CMakeLists and cssapp.cmake
files are included in the directory 'cmake'. These need to be copied to
the proper locations as explained below.

In theory, any Linux based system with up-to-date gcc versions and the 
proper libraries for visulization should be able to compile and run this 
program.  However, the authors will promise nothing.


INSTALLATION:
=============

Introduction:
-------------
Installation is done by cloning the GitHub repository to an fresh, clean 
directory on your system.  If you can compile and run the GEANT4 examples 
you should be fine with this program.  


Files & Directories:
--------------------
Successful cloning of the GitHub repository will result in
the following files and directory structure beneath the current
directory which I call the parent directory {parent-dir}.  The 
directory will be called {parent-dir}/css/.

    README		--This file

    css.mac		--Main macro file for the application

    vis.mac		--Basic visualization macro for testing

    init_vis.mac	--Default macro file that calls vis.mac as well

    CMakeLists.txt	-- The "standard" CMakeLists file necessary
    			   for the cmake to do its job. A copy is in
			   the folder 'cmake' in case it is deleted.

    cmake/	== includes the files for cmake operation

    include/	== Include files used by CSSapp

    src/	== Source code for used by CSSapp application

Compilation:
-------------
A new directory should be made next to the /css directory called 
css-build.  Inside the 'build' directory the file 'cssapp.cmake' 
needs to copied from the 'cmake' directory in the /css directory.  

Modifications, as needed, to the cmake file (cssapp.cmake) in the build 
directory and the CMakeLists.txt file in the /css must be 
made so as to accomondate your version of GEANT4, debug versus 
production version, etc.  

To compile the program, go to the build directory and execute the command

>> cmake -C cssapp.cmake  {path-to-parent-dir}/css

This will generate the necessary files and make scripts.  If sucessful 
then run the make command 

>> make

or if you want multithread support 

>> make -jN 

where N is the number of threads you want to use for compiling the program.
The application executable cssapp should appear in the build directory along
with the macro file(s) [css.mac, vis.mac, init_vis.mac].

Data Files:
-----------

Before compiling and running the cssapp, you will need to make sure 
the correct data files are not only installed but the environmental 
variables point to them correctly.  If you setup GEANT4 with them 
installed then this should already be taken care of.

USING cssapp:
=============
The program is then ran using 

>> ./cssapp css.mac

on the command line.  In the css.mac macro file you can change the number
of events, energy of the gamma ray, gamma ray source, and other
possible settings.  See GEANT4 documentation for more information.

OUTPUT:
=======

Output to the screen is currently printed every 1000 events but can be 
changed in the program or on the command line via runmanager commands.
The results from eventaction are printed.  The results for EACH event are
stored as an Ntuple in a root file in the build directory.
